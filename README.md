# noteDash

Notetaking and productivity tool - organize and link notes spatially.

This is the project page for the iOS app, which is the primary distribution channel for this application. Changes to the Dart code that would complement the desktop version well will be ported to the Flutter project I have for generating the MSIX package. Being cross-platform, feel free to compile however you wish. It may just take extra tweaking.
